# Comparative-study-of-ML-techniques-using-synthetic-health-data

A university MSC dissertation on the topic of outcome prediction in emgergency departments in NHS Wales. At this point, genuine health data was not available, therefore synthetic data was generated.

The project aimed to compare different ML techniques such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-nearest Neighbour etc. to see which yielded highest prediction accuracy.

There is also some basic data analysis and the data generation is included.

This was created on Jupyter Notebook and therefore contains a lot of text, there are also additional comments. I would lay the code out differently now, but this is an early proof of concept.

Keras and scikit-learn are needed to run this, alongside other standard libraries.
